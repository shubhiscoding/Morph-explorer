# Morph-explorer

I'm creating the Morph Explorer Bot, a Telegram bot designed to simplify blockchain exploration for newcomers in the crypto space. The bot leverages Telegram's popularity and user-friendly interface, requiring only a wallet address from users to access a range of features. Users can retrieve recent transactions, track token transfers, view held tokens, check current gas prices, and search for tokens by name or address. This approach aims to make blockchain exploration more accessible and intuitive, especially for those unfamiliar with traditional blockchain explorers. The bot is currently using Morph Explorer's testnet API, specifically for the Morph testnet.
